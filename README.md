You can deploy the workbook directly to your Azure environment using the button above.

Clicking this button will open the Azure Portal with your template pre-loaded for deployment.

1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button above.
2. The Azure Portal will open a custom deployment blade with the workbook template pre-loaded.
3. Fill in the required fields (such as Subscription, Resource Group, Location, and Workbook Name).
4. Click **Review + create**, then **Create** to deploy the workbook.
5. After deployment, go to the selected Resource Group, find the deployed workbook under **Workbooks**, and open it.

## Workbook Structure

The workbook is organized into **four main tabs**:

### 1. 📋 Overview

- **VM Inventory Summary**: Unified sortable, filterable, exportable table combining VM compute, network, and disk data across all selected subscriptions
- Columns include: VM Name, VM Size, OS Type, Power State, OS Disk, Data Disk Count, Total Storage, NICs, Private IPs, VNets, Accelerated Networking, NSGs, Tags

### 2. 🖥️ VM

Six sub-tabs covering the full compute inventory:

| Sub-tab | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Summary** | Aggregate tile counts — Total VMs, Powered On, Deallocated, Stopped, Windows VMs, Linux VMs |
| **VM Inventory** | Full VM list with SKU, OS, power state, vCPUs/Cores, ESU Billable Cores, Core Size, provisioning state, disk summary, NIC details |
| **SKU** | Bar chart + table of VM size distribution |
| **Boot Diagnostics** | Per-VM boot diagnostics status: Enabled/Disabled, Managed vs. Custom storage |
| **VM Extensions** | Installed extensions per VM with publisher, type, version, and auto-upgrade setting |
| **AHB Status** | Azure Hybrid Benefit summary + per-VM license type |
| **Core Governance** | Core Governance summary + Core Governance per VM |


### 3. 🌐 Networking

Per-NIC network configuration for each VM:

- VNet and subnet names
- NIC name and private IP address
- IP allocation method (Static / Dynamic)
- Accelerated Networking and IP Forwarding status
- Associated NSG name

### 4. 💾 Disk

Aggregated disk count and size per VM:

- OS disk size (GB) and storage type (SKU)
- Data disk count
- Total data disk storage (GB)
- Total storage (OS + data disks, GB)

## Filters and Scoping

All tabs respond dynamically to the **four global filters** at the top of the workbook:

| Filter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Subscription** | Multi-select — defaults to all your subscriptions |
| **Location** | Filter by Azure region; dynamically populated from your VMs |
| **OS Type** | Windows / Linux |
| **Power State** | Running, Deallocated, Stopped, etc. |

> **Tip:** Apply filters before exporting to download only the data you need.

## Export and Reporting

Every tab supports **Download to Excel** (⬇). Click the button above any table to export the current filtered view as a `.xlsx` file.
